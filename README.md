# Installing a Scientific Computing Environment in Oracle Ampere

Oracle Cloud is unique in offering Arm-powered servers with up to threads 160 cores for heaving threading applications. ARM processor are well known component of embedded systems and mobiles, but little is known about their use for scientific application. Oracle Cloud now offers the opportunity of running in the cloud applications that require massive multithreading, which was before only possible in HPC bare-bone systems.

In this guide I'll share the steps I'll share with the community about how do I manage to install libraries that helped me to have a fully working system for my scientific applications.

# Installing Miniconda for Arch architecture

A very standards tool we use for scientific computing is Anaconda Environemt. If you don't know yet what is Anaconda I would suggest you first read one of the blog posts that explain what Anaconda is and how it could be used in data science and other applications: https://towardsdatascience.com/anaconda-start-here-for-data-science-in-python-475045a9627
